# AI Building

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

during this project i would like to make an AI that has the same capacity and ability like the ones in games (cortana from halo series as an example).
doing this would mean we could launch humanity forward into a possible golden era of technology and architecture.


## Background

doing what i want to attempt with ai would mean we would be able to solve overpopulation and food shortages etc.


## Data sources and AI methods

considering i am mostly going to have to start from scratch i dont have any sources right now.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

if the AI will be able to feel emotions would it be morally wrong to keep it contained to a system without access to the outside world? basically jailing a sentient without a just cause.

## What next?

i would need to specialize in AI and would have to study neurology.
